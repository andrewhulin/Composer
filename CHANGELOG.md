# Changelog

Newest first. Every milestone adds an entry. A **Decisions** list records each default picked without asking, so it can be revisited.

## M0 · Repo and docs · 2026-11-04

### Added
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` covers:
  - the data model
  - the node type system
  - the execution engine
  - storage
  - prompt assembly
  - connectors
  - Build, Share and Foundations
- `PLAN.md` holds milestones M0–M10 and the verification plan.

### Decisions
- **Agreed with Andrew:**
  - Sources use direct APIs with tokens in Keychain.
  - Build ships code and Figma output in v1.
  - Share uses Remotion and other creative tooling.
- **Model:** Claude Opus 5.5 (`claude-opus-5-5`) everywhere by default.
  - Adaptive thinking, with effort set per recipe.
  - Server-side refusal fallback is on.
  - Model can be overridden per node.
  - Utility calls default to Opus 5.5 at low effort and can be switched to Haiku 5.5.
- **Context budget:** 200k per node by default, as drawn in Figma. Configurable.
- **Figma copy fixes:**
  - Canvas rails say Understand and Build, not Empathize and Ideate.
  - Define's output is "Testable statement".
  - Share's output is "Release story".
- **Styling:** CSS variables and CSS Modules (no Tailwind). Geist and Geist Mono are bundled. `motion` for animation.
- **Database:** custom rusqlite commands on one connection instead of tauri-plugin-sql. Transactions must not split across pooled connections.
- **Snapshots:** content-addressed blobs, and every snapshot is a manifest hash, as in git. Locked outputs are firewalls: the next phase consumes a specific version through an inlet.
- **Prompt context:** trimmed by weighted water-filling over atomic units, never summarized. Each run stores an AssemblyReport showing what was cut.
- **Remotion license:** free for individuals and companies of up to 3 employees. Slingshot work needs a Company License. The renderer is isolated behind an interface.
